   <h2>Day 16</h2>
   --Today I studied some Javascript objects and did some grids challenge
   <h3>Notes</h3>
   <p>Javascript is Dynamically typed and objects are collections of data</p>
   <p>Objects link to one memory location</p>
   <p>CSS Grids are really interesting , Enjoying it</p>

 <h2>Day 17</h2>
   --Today I studied some Javascript statements and tackled FCC CSS accessability
   <h3>Notes</h3>
   <p>Javascript uses if statements to check certain conditions</p>
   <p>header tags are great for accessibility , and more semantic </p>
