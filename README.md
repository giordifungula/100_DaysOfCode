   <h2>Day 16</h2>
   --Today I studied some Javascript objects and did some grids challenge
   <h3>Notes</h3>
   <p>Javascript is Dynamically typed and objects are collections of data</p>
   <p>Objects link to one memory location</p>
   <p>CSS Grids are really interesting , Enjoying it</p>

 <h2>Day 17</h2>
   --Today I studied some Javascript statements and tackled FCC CSS accessability
   <h3>Notes</h3>
   <p>Javascript uses if statements to check certain conditions</p>
   <p>header tags are great for accessibility , and more semantic </p>

<h2>Day 18</h2>
   --Today I studied some Javascript classes and objects
   <h3>Notes</h3>
   <p>Classes serve as a base for other objects or related objects</p>
   <p>Other note was to use Let because it is block scoped and not global like var </p>

   <h2>Day 19</h2>
   --Today I studied some Javascript arrow functions
   <h3>Notes</h3>
   <p>Arrow functions are a shorter and a more concise way of writing functions</p>
   <p>They prepare you to write modern JS code </p>

   <h2>Day 20</h2>
   --Today I studied some Javascript closures
   <h3>Notes</h3>
   <p>If you have made a function then you have work with closures , you may or may not understand it fully but its okay</p>
   <p>I also practised some CSS positioning </p>
